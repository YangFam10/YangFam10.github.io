			<p>Justin really enjoys experiencing narratives told through the medium of Manga. Manga to Justin is what books are
                what books are to other people. Without manga, he wouldn't be who he is today. Manga has a unique way of blending
                words and images to create otherworldy narratives that can be told in a 30-minute sitting, or a told over 20-years.
                His favorite manga is One Piece.
